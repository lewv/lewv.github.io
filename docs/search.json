She is having data issues with BruinLearn so has a smaller (1,119 observation 5 variable set from Summer 2023) instead of full set with additional information\n\n\nRecall\nWe met with Christine Holten at the Faculty Center in November. She’s with the writing program. It turns out that we cannot access any of her data on BruinLearn (maybe in the future, but the tools don’t exist right now)\n\n\nHer questions\n\nWhat is the correlation between our placement and students’ course preference – Can we rely on the students’ course preference selection alone to get similar placement result patterns as we get when we ourselves place students based on the reading/writing essay that they complete? Or asked in a different way, when can we rely on students’ course preference selections to get similar placement patterns as we get when we place students ourselves? When can we not rely on their course selections?\n\ncorrelation between students’ post-AWPE survey scores, students’ course preference, and our placement of students – When can we rely on students’ course preferences in combination with their post-AWPE survey results to give us similar placement result patterns as when we ourselves place students based on the reading/writing essay?\n\ncorrelation between student our placement, student course preference, post-AWPE survey scores and unweighted GPA – Can unweighted GPA serve as an independent measure to help us determine when to accept students’ course preference & survey results and when not to accept students’ course preference and place them ourselves?\n\n\n\nHer data\nThey do keep some data outside of BruinLearn, here are 1,119 student results from last summer:\n\n\nCode\noptions(width = 120)\nlibrary(readr) \nholten &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewv/S24STATS101A/main/data/holten.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 1119 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): ENG COMP Placement, Course Preference, H/L/A\ndbl (2): Post-AWPE Survey, Unweighted GPA\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nhead(holten)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  `ENG COMP Placement` `Course Preference` `Post-AWPE Survey` `H/L/A` `Unweighted GPA`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1                    1                                   27 A                   3.78\n2 1                    1                                   28 A                   4   \n3 1                    1                                   28 A                   3.55\n4 1                    1                                   28 A                   3.92\n5 1                    1                                   30 A                   3.93\n6 1                    1                                   31 A                   3.4 \n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n(omitted) Column A – UID\n\nColumn B – ENG COMP Placement (that is the English composition course our raters placed them in – the possible placements are:\n\nEnglish Comp. 1 (Entry Level Writing course – students need to take EC 1 and 2 before Writing I)\nEnglish Comp. 2 (Entry Level Writing course – students need to take EC 2 before Writing I)\nEnglish Comp. 1B (Entry Level Writing course for multilingual writers – students need to take EC 1B and 2i before Writing I)\nEnglish Comp. 2i (Entry Level Writing course for multilingual writers – students need to take EC 2i before Writing I)\nEnglish Comp. 3 (Writing I)\n\n\nColumn C – Course Preference (that is the English composition course the student chose for themselves)\n\nColumn D – Post-AWPE Survey (the highest score is 54 – there were 18 questions on the survey with a choice of A - 1 pt., B - 2 pts., C - 3 pts.)\n\nColumn E – H/L/A – this indicates whether the students course preference was higher/accurate/lower than where we placed them\n\nColumn F – unweighted GPA (this is the student’s self-reported high school GPA, which we obtained from Admissions) – we are hoping to use this as an independent measure\n\n\n\nTables\nHer data is a little “dirty” Column B (actual Writing program placement) and Column C (self-placement) have different values. Column D I think she means the possible is 54, the high score according to her data is 48.\n\n\nCode\nlapply(holten, table)\n\n\n$`ENG COMP Placement`\n\n  1  1B   2  2i   3 \n 48   7 455  19 590 \n\n$`Course Preference`\n\n   -    1    2 2, 1    3    4    5 \n   1  104  459    1  491   10   26 \n\n$`Post-AWPE Survey`\n\n24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 \n 1  3  5  4 17 14 26 26 41 41 60 74 86 80 91 75 89 62 72 77 62 53 27 21  5 \n\n$`H/L/A`\n\n  A   H   L \n571 199 322 \n\n$`Unweighted GPA`\n\n   0 2.03 2.33 2.45  2.5 2.57 2.65 2.66  2.7 2.78 2.92 2.95 2.96    3 3.04 3.05 3.07 3.08 3.13 3.15 3.16 3.17  3.2 3.21 \n  42    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    2    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    2    1    1    1    1 \n3.23 3.25 3.27 3.28 3.29  3.3 3.31 3.33 3.34 3.36 3.37 3.38  3.4 3.41 3.42 3.43 3.44 3.45 3.46 3.47 3.48  3.5 3.51 3.52 \n   3    1    2    1    4    3    2    2    1    1    3    1    5    1    4    1    4    3    2    4    1    9    1    1 \n3.53 3.54 3.55 3.56 3.57 3.58 3.59  3.6 3.61 3.62 3.63 3.64 3.65 3.66 3.67 3.68 3.69  3.7 3.71 3.72 3.73 3.74 3.75 3.76 \n   3    4    2    1    4    4    2    5    4    4    6    3    6   11    6    6    8   10    6    7    7    5    9    7 \n3.77 3.78 3.79  3.8 3.81 3.82 3.83 3.84 3.85 3.86 3.87 3.88 3.89  3.9 3.91 3.92 3.93 3.94 3.95 3.96 3.97 3.98    4 \n  10    9   10   20   11   14   11   15   16   16   17   24   13   39   22   43   20    5   56   67    8    2  405 \n\n\nI wanted to check Column E (H/L/A) against B and C crossed\n\n\nCode\ntable(holten$`H/L/A`, holten$`ENG COMP Placement`, holten$`Course Preference`)\n\n\n, ,  = -\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A   0   0   0   0   0\n  H   0   0   0   0   0\n  L   0   0   0   0   0\n\n, ,  = 1\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A  13   1   0   0   0\n  H   0   0   0   0   0\n  L   0   0  58   0  32\n\n, ,  = 2\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A   0   0 217   5   0\n  H  22   1   0   0   0\n  L   0   0   0   0 214\n\n, ,  = 2, 1\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A   0   0   1   0   0\n  H   0   0   0   0   0\n  L   0   0   0   0   0\n\n, ,  = 3\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A   0   0   0   0 319\n  H   9   2 153   8   0\n  L   0   0   0   0   0\n\n, ,  = 4\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A   1   0   0   0   0\n  H   0   0   0   0   0\n  L   0   0   4   0   5\n\n, ,  = 5\n\n   \n      1  1B   2  2i   3\n  A   0   0   9   5   0\n  H   1   3   0   0   0\n  L   0   0   0   0   8"
